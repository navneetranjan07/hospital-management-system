# TODO: Add Scroll Animations to HospitalInfo.jsx

- [ ] Import `motion` from `framer-motion` in HospitalInfo.jsx
- [ ] Define reusable animation variants (e.g., fadeInUp for slide-up effect)
- [ ] Wrap all major sections (About, Mission & Vision, Departments, Doctors, Contact, Footer) with `motion.div` for slide-up on scroll
- [ ] Add staggered animations for grid items (Departments cards, Doctors profiles)
- [ ] Test animations by running `npm run dev` and scrolling through the page
- [ ] Verify no layout shifts or performance issues; adjust if needed
