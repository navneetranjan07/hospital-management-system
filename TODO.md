# TODO for Redesigning Login.jsx

## Plan Breakdown:
- [ ] Step 1: Update the main container to use the hero_bg.jpg as background image with a dark overlay for readability.
- [ ] Step 2: Adjust the login card styling to better integrate with the new background (e.g., increase opacity or tweak colors for contrast).
- [ ] Step 3: Enhance modern elements subtly, such as adding a hospital-themed icon or improving animations.
- [ ] Step 4: Verify functionality remains intact and test visually (e.g., via browser).
